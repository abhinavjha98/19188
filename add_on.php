    <p align="center">More and more, job roles are requiring formal training qualifications either because of legislative requirements or to meet the requirements of specific employers.
Developing your skills through further training provides significant benefits.</p>
<br>
<p><b><u>Increase employment opportunities</u></b><br>
Without doubt training provides increased employment opportunities. Today, even entry level roles in many industries require base level qualifications. By completing a training course, your employment opportunities become wider.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Increased career development opportunities</u></b><br>
Developing a career in a chosen field is something many of us aspire to. Experience alone, in many cases does not suffice when employers are seeking to promote their staff. By undertaking further training, the opportunity to develop your career is enhanced.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Personal growth</u></b><br>
Training not only provides you with the skills in a particular area. By undertaking further training you build your networking, time management, communication and negotiation skills.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Increase your knowledge and understanding of your local industry</u></b><br>
Interskills trainers are experts in their fields – they are closely connected within their industry. This provides you with local industry knowledge to supplement your growing skills.</p>

In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving"</p>

Derivation of rate expressions from reaction mechanisms and equilibrium or steady state assumptions. Design of chemical and biochemical reactors via synthesis of chemical kinetics, transport phenomena, and mass and energy balances. Topics in this course include: chemical/biochemical pathways; enzymatic, pathway, and cell growth kinetics; batch, plug flow and well-stirred reactors for chemical reactions and cultivations of microorganisms and mammalian cells; heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis; heat and mass transport in reactors, including diffusion to and within catalyst particles and cells or immobilized enzymes.</p>

As a computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) engineering technologist, you’ll help turn great ideas into practical plans.It’s a career that applies science to mechanical design, so it helps to have an analytical mind and good math skills. You’ll be involved in everything from design and drafting, to fabrication, 3D printing and prototype development.</p>

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
